# Common_Connectors

Sorting through publicly available data has become the new information barrier now days. These Common_Connector files are made as an  advanced organizing and experimental tool for quickly linking data layers to your own projects.

The Connector files are used to group together selected layers by varying topics, regardless to their original sources or publishing services. Looking up and adding a layer from the Connector file is made easy with "Embedded layer and groups" or using the browser panel to show the project's already organized layers tree.  Additional major advantage of using these Connector files is the possibility to embed the connected layer with your own default styling and settings including filters. Potentially, on addition for being a great organizing tool, these Connector files are a suggestion for a new type of media - aimed at republishing and connect in new ways to already openly available data for the QGiS community.

You are more then welcome to upload files of you own here. For professional reasons my own Connector files will be mostly referencing Israel
